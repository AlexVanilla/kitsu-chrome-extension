# Currently on hold to focus on getting employment

# Kitsu Chrome Extension

Gets the watchlist of the user's Kitsu/Hummingbird account

Update your watchlist from your browser!

Prevent the unnecessary keeping a tab open to update your watchlist!

It's hot!  It's neat!  It can't be beat!

Unfortunately, I have to put this on hold to focus on some life stuff going on (aka: getting a job)

Though I do have a couple roadmap features I want to implement when I find time

* Have login component redirect to my watchlist component
* Implement caching to store users information
* Implement search feature
* Take out bootstrap and implement own stylesheet (preferably SCSS I wanna pick up a CSS preprocessor)
* Have drop box to filter just anime or manga in the list
* clean up code

## Other notes
* Using [Kitsu Api](https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io/)
* Utilzing React and Bootstrap
